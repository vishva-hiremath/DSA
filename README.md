# DSA
DSA for Java
Data Structures

Time Complexity - How fast code runs based on the time 
Space Complexity - How much memory does the code take to execute. Space > Memory. 

Omega - Best Case
Theta - Average Case
Omicron or Big O - Worst Case

O(n) > Drop constants > Proportional 
O(n2) > Loop with in a loop
O(n+ 2) - Drop non dominants 
O(1) - Constant time - only one operation
O(log n) - Divide and Conquer
O (a + b) - When inputs are different.

When n is 100:
o(n) - 100 operations
o(1) - 1 operation
o(n2) - 10000 operations
o(log n) - 7 operations
