Pseudo Code:
Initialize two pointers: slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the list.
Move fast k steps ahead:
Start a for loop that iterates k times.
Inside the loop, check if fast is null. If it is, the list has fewer than k nodes, so return null.
Move fast one step ahead (i.e., fast = fast.next).
Start a while loop that continues until fast is null:
Move slow one step ahead (i.e., slow = slow.next).
Move fast one step ahead (i.e., fast = fast.next).
When the while loop ends, slow will point to the k-th node from the end of the list. Return slow.

This algorithm uses the two-pointer technique to efficiently find the k-th node from the end of the linked list.


Explained another way:

The algorithm uses two pointers, called 'slow' and 'fast'. Both of these pointers start at the head of the list (the beginning of the chain).
First, 'fast' is moved 'k' steps along the list. If 'fast' encounters the end of the list (represented by 'null') before it has taken 'k' steps, the function returns 'null' because the list is shorter than 'k' elements.
If 'fast' successfully takes 'k' steps without reaching the end of the list, then the game changes. Now, both 'slow' and 'fast' start moving along the list at the same pace, one step at a time.
Here's the clever bit: by the time 'fast' hits the end of the list, 'slow' will be 'k' steps behind it - and therefore 'k' steps from the end of the list. So the function returns 'slow'.
This is a common technique in computer science known as the 'fast-pointer / slow-pointer' or 'runner' technique, and it's a neat way of finding a position relative to the end of a list in a single pass.


Explained yet another way:

This code is kind of like a game of tag, where you and your friend are running along a straight line of stones (these stones are like the "nodes" of our linked list). You're "slow" and your friend is "fast".
The rule of the game is your friend gets a head start and runs "k" stones ahead first.
If your friend runs out of stones before counting to "k" (when fast equals null), then you know the line of stones is not long enough (return null).
But if there are enough stones, after your friend's head start, you both start running together. If your friend hits the end of the line (when fast equals null again), the stone you are standing on is "k" stones from the end.
And that's the stone this code is trying to find!
